## My Goal for things I need to get done before 10/26/2023 are: ##
  - getting the V1 compiler to run on my system
    -- Compiler has been built.  gen-coverage.sh fails due to missing packages in os env
  - making a list of what I want to do in this project

## What I want to consider doing on this project.  List likely to be narrowed down ##
  - TDD with mutation testing on V1 Compiler
  - automatted HSM test code generator V1 Compiler and V2 if possible
  - fuzzing testing parts of the V1 compiler
  - verification/validation (likely way too big to do and perhaps not possible)
